## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a **fraud detection system** that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions based on transaction data. The project demonstrates how to preprocess the data, build machine learning models, and evaluate them for high accuracy.

Key steps involved in the project:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Training and Testing
4. Evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC Curve

## Features

- **Fraud detection**: Detects fraudulent credit card transactions from a given dataset.
- **Multiple machine learning models**: Implements Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and other classifiers for fraud detection.
- **Model evaluation**: Evaluates the performance using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC Curve.
- **Streamlit App**: Provides a user interface where users can upload their own data and get fraud predictions.
- **Visualization**: Key transaction patterns and model performance visualizations.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Programming language used.
- **Streamlit**: Used to build the web application.
- **scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning algorithms.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting library for visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: Data visualization library.
- **GitHub Actions**: For continuous integration.
